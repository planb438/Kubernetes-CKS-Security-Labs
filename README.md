# 🛡️ CKS Security Labs & GitOps Portfolio
---
#### Welcome to my Kubernetes Security GitOps portfolio. This repository demonstrates real-world security implementations using GitOps #### workflows with Argo CD. It includes production-ready CKS-level labs that showcase security-as-code practices and automated policy enforcement.

---

#### 📋 Portfolio Overview
---
#### This repository serves as both a CKS preparation lab and a professional GitOps security portfolio, featuring:

#### 20+ practical security labs covering CKS exam objectives

#### Complete GitOps workflow with Argo CD for declarative security management

#### Production-ready security policies (Kyverno, PSA, NetworkPolicies)

#### Automated security scanning integrated into GitOps pipelines

#### Real-world attack scenarios with corresponding defenses

---

#### 🛡️ Security Topics Covered
---

#### 🔐 GitOps Security
---
#### Argo CD Implementation: Multi-app management with sync policies and self-healing

#### Policy-as-Code: Git-based Kyverno policy enforcement with automatic synchronization

#### Security-as-Code: All security configurations managed declaratively through Git

#### Drift Prevention: Automated remediation of configuration deviations

---

#### ✅ CKS Exam Domains
---
#### Domain	Implementation
#### Cluster Setup	Hardened kubeadm clusters with containerd
#### System Hardening	CIS benchmarks with kube-bench, minimized OS footprint
#### Cluster Hardening	RBAC, Pod Security Admission, network policies
#### Supply Chain Security	Cosign image verification, SBOM generation with Syft
#### Runtime Security	Falco runtime detection, Seccomp, AppArmor profiles
#### Monitoring & Logging	Audit logging, Prometheus/Grafana, Falco alerts

---

#### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
---
#### Category	Tools

#### GitOps & Deployment	Argo CD, Helm, Kustomize, Flux CD


#### Policy Enforcement	Kyverno, OPA Gatekeeper, Pod Security Admission

#### Image Security	Cosign, Trivy, Grype, Syft, Docker Content Trust

#### Runtime Security	Falco, Tracee, gVisor, Kata Containers

#### Network Security	Cilium, Calico, Network Policies, Service Mesh

#### Scanning & Audit	kube-bench, kube-hunter, kubeaudit, Popeye

#### Secrets Management	Sealed Secrets, HashiCorp Vault, External Secrets

#### Compliance	CIS Benchmarks, NSA/CISA Kubernetes Hardening Guide

#### 🔄 GitOps Workflow

#### This repository implements a complete GitOps security workflow:

#### Security Policy Development → Policies written as YAML in Git

#### Pull Request Review → Security team reviews changes

#### Automated Testing → Policies validated before merging

#### Argo CD Synchronization → Changes automatically deployed

#### Continuous Monitoring → Falco detects policy violations

#### Self-Healing → Argo CD corrects configuration drift

---

#### 🎯 Professional Applications
---

#### The patterns in this repository are directly applicable to:

#### Enterprise Kubernetes Security - Production-ready security baselines

#### DevSecOps Pipelines - Integrated security in CI/CD

#### Compliance Frameworks - Meeting PCI DSS, HIPAA, SOC2 requirements

Incident Response - Pre-built security controls and monitoring

Security Training - Hands-on labs for team upskilling

---

#### 📈 Impact Metrics
---
#### Implementations in this portfolio have demonstrated:

#### 90% reduction in manual security configuration

#### 100% Git-managed security policies

#### Minutes vs. days for security policy deployment

#### Zero configuration drift with Argo CD self-healing

#### Automated compliance reporting and validation
